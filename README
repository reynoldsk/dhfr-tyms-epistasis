These mutant count files were generated by Thuy Nguyen on 5/14/2021 from her
raw sequencing data.

** PROCESS OF COUNT GENERATION:
The process for creating these files was as follows:

Sequencing reads were generated by a paired end 300 cycle run on either an Illumina HiSeq
or MiSeq. These runs span days worth of experiments.The reads were merged using the program USEARCH.
The sequencing reads were filtered by Q-score (all reads were required to be q-score > 20),
and assigned to a particular DHFR mutation or WT. The mutation counts were then adjusted
by subtracting a correction that accounts for the expected number of reads simply due to errors in sequencing the WT (which represents the largest portion of our library).
This "read-hopping" correction takes into account the q-score cutoff (20 or better), the
number of WT reads at a given time point, and the number of nucleotide substitutions
seperating the mutation of interest from WT. Finally, the adjusted sequencing counts were
randomly subsampled to give equivalent coverage across all sequencing experiments, to
ensure a similar dynamic range and level of noise across replicates.


** FORMAT:
Each file is tab delimited, with the following headers:
     - Mutant
     - Replicate
     - TYMS variant
     - t0 counts (for the mutant)
     - t4 counts (for the mutant)
     - t8 counts (for the mutant)
     - t12 counts (for the mutant)
     - t20 counts (for the mutant)
     - t24 counts (for the mutant)
     - t0 counts (for the WT reference)
     - t4 counts (for the WT reference)
     - t8 counts (for the WT reference)
     - t12 counts (for the WT reference)
     - t20 counts (for the WT reference)
     - t24 counts (for the WT reference)

WT counts are listed on each row because they vary between replicates, as well as sublibraries.
By repeating the WT counts on each row, we ensure that each mutant is normalized to the correct
WT (which results from sequencing a given turbidostat vial -->
each vial reflects a unique replicate/sublibrary/TYMS combination).
